<p>- Enjoy!
<p>I make a changes in installer and autoupdater to  copy all files to install dir, run autoupdate and start RDPConf to check if it works.
<p>Also i change the uninstaller to remove install dir.</b>
<p>
<p>I like to use it, and now (from build 18362.836) i try to make it working on every release x64 by myself.
